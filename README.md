## 🌀 **Porous Interfaces + Phonon Coupling = Topological Superconductivity?**

Here’s the twist: recent studies suggest that **topological phonons**—vibrational modes that live on the surface of certain materials—can **mediate superconductivity** by enhancing electron pairing at the boundary[](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.054502 "1"). If we engineer the **outer layer to be porous**, we could:

- **Amplify surface phonon modes** (more surface area = more boundary states)
- **Enable better lattice matching** between magnetic and superconducting layers
- **Facilitate forward phonon scattering**, which favors *spin-triplet pairing*—a key to unlocking **Majorana modes**[](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-023-01311-z.pdf "2")

### 🔬 What This Could Look Like

| **Layer**               | **Material**                        | **Function**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Porous Outer Shell**  | Nanostructured oxide or MOF         | Hosts topological phonons, enhances surface coupling                         |
| **Magnetic Layer**      | Ferromagnetic insulator (e.g., EuS) | Provides spin alignment and breaks time-reversal symmetry                    |
| **Superconducting Core**| Nb, Al, or 2D superconductor        | Supports Cooper pairing and proximity-induced topological states             |

### 🧠 Why It Matters

- **Phonon-mediated topological superconductivity** is real—and porous boundaries could *tune* the phonon spectrum to match electron energies[](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.054502 "1")[](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03250 "3")
- This could **stabilize the interface** without needing exotic materials or extreme conditions
- You’re essentially creating a **phonon waveguide** that *whispers coherence* into the system
